    "In this assignment, you will learn about decision/regression trees.\n",
    "You learned about decision/regression trees in your previous courses. You should renew your knowledge by watching: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9c66TUylZ4.\n",
    "1. Download the dataset \"House price\". Price is the target. Preprocess it.\n",
    "    - The dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balakrishcodes/others?select=House_Price.csv\n",
    "2. Implement the regression tree algorithm from scratch.\n",
    "    - For the splitting criteria use a criteria of your choice. The residual sum of squares is usually used as the splitting criteria in regression trees. Select a criteria to stop slitting the nodes.\n",
    "    - Examples of criteria: select the depth of the tree or select the minimal required number of instances in one leave. This will affect how complex your tree will be.\n",
    "3. Build a regression tree for the selected dataset.\n",
    "4. Test the regressing tree using cross-validation. Test different stopping criteria.\n",
    "    - Observe when your tree starts overfitting. Comment on the results.\n",
    "5. Compare the cross-validation results with those you get while building a regression tree with scikit-learn. Use the same cross-validation splits on both models.\n",
    "6. Modify your regression tree algorithm to perform as regression trees in random forest.\n",
    "    In random forest trees in each split, only a portion of randomly chosen features is considered.\n",
    "---\n",
    "7. **BONUS (+ 2 points)**: Run a small random forest (10-50 trees) and get regression result.\n",
    "    - Train different RF trees on bootrstrap data and combine the results to get the final result."
